I can ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure by using white box testing to get a good idea of what the program intends and how it will be interpreted by users.
I can use black box testing to ensure that the programs functionality is not easily broken by the user or other external factors. 
I would also try to get outside perspectives so i am not being too biased in my work. 
I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program by creating psuedocode that encompasses the idea that the user story envelops and then continue to add parameters based on questioning the users needs, the limits of the program, and the users potential input. 
I approach designing software with an objective attitude. 
I like to try to keep my code tested through all stages and will try to poke and prod my way through design by creating robust and well thought out unit tests.
